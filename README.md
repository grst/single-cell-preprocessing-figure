An overview of different single-cell processing paths (from counts to UMAP)

Starting with
an unfiltered, high-dimensional count matrix, technical artifacts such as doublets and
low-quality cells are removed. Normalization and variance stabilizing transformations
(VST) of filtered counts can be performed with various strategies. Optional feature
selection (feat. sel.) of ca. 2000â€“6000 genes can be performed on either filtered or
normalized counts. Based on the normalized, transformed counts, a low-dimensional
latent space can be computed using principal component analysis (PCA). Alterna-
tively, other methods can derive a latent space directly from the filtered counts. Us-
ing the latent space, a neighborhood graph is derived, which serves as the basis for
unsupervised clustering and dimensionality reduction methods such as uniform man-
ifold approximation and projection (UMAP). Batch effect correction may be applied
as dedicated steps at different points in the workflow, or may be integrated in other
processing steps.
